Hepatica is a mobile application designed to provide a seamless healthcare experience for both patients and doctors. The app allows users to book appointments, manage medications, communicate with healthcare providers, and receive personalized health recommendations.

## Project Overview ðŸ“±

Our App caters to two primary user categories: patients and doctors. Patients can easily book appointments, manage their medications, and access personalized health recommendations. Doctors can view patient profiles, manage appointments, and communicate with patients directly through the app.
